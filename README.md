## What kind of texts are possible to generate?

## Text Generation Variables

There are some variables that you need to send before making a request to Hemingwai.

Here is a brief summary of what those variables are:

- `prompt`: Prompting the HemingwAI to start writing on a specific subject

- `creativity`: Floating number between 0-1. 0 being the lowest creativity and 1 being the highest. Default is 0.7

- `character_length`: Integer which defines the maximum amount of characters that can be produced by the HemingwAI

- `source_language`: Language code of the source language of the written prompt. for example 'en' for English and 'de' for German.
  [We support 72 languages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html#what-is-languages). If you don't know the language code you can also use 'auto' for this field to automatically sense the input language.

- `parameters`: Used for setting the tone of the generated copy text. It can be basically anything but please keep it plausible :)
